Gaming Codes allows each user to enter his gamer codes for "next-gen" consoles.

== Description ==

Gaming Codes allows each user to enter his gamer codes for "next-gen" consoles. These codes can be displayed in posts as author information.

Also, this plugin can use another plugin, "El Aleph", to generate lists of users that have codes for a certain platform.

You can see an example here: http://www.ryuuko.cl/gente/mrhadoken/ . This is a profile page in El Aleph, showing two gamer codes and the user description.

This plugin is licensed under the terms of the GPL v3. Please see the file license.txt.

= Features =

If you don't have 'El Aleph' installed: 

* Each user can add his/her own gamer code(s) for Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, XBox 360, PlayStation Network and GGPO.net.
* A template tag for post loops: `the_author_gaming_codes`.

If you have 'El Aleph' installed:

* A template tag for user loops: `the_user_gaming_codes`.
* An user list of people having gamer codes in a certain console/system. The template tag `gaming_codes_links` displays links to those user lists.
* The template tag `is_gaming_code_listing` returns true if the user is browsing a list based on gaming codes.
* You can make more complex user queries intersecting Gaming Codes and the AuthorInterests taxonomy. For example, you could find all the users having a PSN ID that likes the game "Metal Gear Solid 4".
